## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - For bundling
- [SaSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - For API calls

### What I learned

With this project I learned key TypeScript concepts such as interfaces, types, and generics. I also learned how to use the axios library to make API calls and how to use the localStorage API to store data in the browser. I also learned how to use the clipboard API to copy text to the clipboard.


My way to handle the copy to clipboard functionality was to use the clipboard API. I used the navigator.clipboard.writeText() method to copy the text to the clipboard. I also used the useState hook to keep track of the copied state and change the button's text accordingly.

```ts
function ShortenerResult({originalUrl, shortUrl}: ShortenedObject ) {

    const [copied, setCopied] = useState<boolean>(false);

    const handleCopy = () => {
        navigator.clipboard.writeText(shortUrl);
        setCopied(true);
    }

    return (
        <div className="shortener-result">
            <p className="original-url">{originalUrl}</p>
            <div className="desktop-right">
                <p className="short-url">{shortUrl}</p>
                <button onClick={handleCopy} className={`hoovered ${copied ? 'copied' : 'not-copied'}`}>{copied ? 'Copied!': 'Copy'}</button>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep working in projects that involve external API calls and data manipulation. I also want to keep working on my CSS skills and learn more about animations and transitions.

### Useful resources

- [Click Outside to Close - React Hook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfZ7pdhS43s&t=2s) - Great video that helped me detect when the user clicks outside of a component. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
